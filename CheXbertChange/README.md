This folder contains our models for the adaptation of CheXbert to change prediction for Tasks 1 and 2.

This code is adapted from the original CheXbert code, that can be found on their GitHub https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/CheXbert. 

Both subfolders CheXbert_task1 and CheXbert_task2 contain modified code and the two notebooks contain code to go trough a full training of the model.
